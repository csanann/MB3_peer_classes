# Mocking Bites 3: Unit testing peer classes
In this work, we explored the concept of testing peer classes in Ruby using RSpec and mock objects. Peer classes are classes that have one-to-one relationship with each other.

## Purpose
The purpose of this work is to help us understand how to write tests for peer classes and ensure their functionality while maintaining a separation of concerns.

## What we have done
1. We went through an example of testing peer classes, specifically 'diaryEntry' and 'DiaryEntryFormatter'. We created unit tests using RSpec and mock objects to ensure that each class was tested independently.
2. We completed an exercise on test-driving the 'TaskFormatter' class using unit tests and mocking.
3. We completed another exercise on test-driving the 'SecretDiary' and 'Diary' classes, focusing on the locking and unlocking behavior of the 'SecretDiary' class.

## Further practice and advice
To gain a deeper understanding of testing peer classes and improve our testing skills, consider the following:
1. Add more features to the classes we have created and write additional tests for them.
2. Experiment with testing technique or methodologies, such as integration testing, BDD, or testing with different mocking libraries.

By working on more examples and expanding your knowledge of testing techniques, we will become more proficient in writing tests for our Ruby code and ensuring the functionality of our peer classes.
